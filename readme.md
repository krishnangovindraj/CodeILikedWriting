## ???
This is literally code i just felt like keeping after I wrote them. I'll try to keep them somewhat organized and recorded in this readme.

The top level is just what language the code is in. Within that, I shall try to organize based on what area ( of computer science) the code would be associated with.

## Contents:

### Python:
- **Compilers/**
	- **prolog_fact_like_parser**
		A naive parser for prolog-fact-like lines.

### Prolog:
- **partial_lhm**
	Use rules & seed-examples to derive all facts entailed.

### CPP
