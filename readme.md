This is literally code i just felt like keeping after I wrote them. I'll try to keep them somewhat organized and recorded in this readme.

The top level is just what language the code is in. Within that, I shall try to organize based on what area ( of computer science) the code would be associated with.

## Contents:

### Python:

### Prolog:

### CPP
